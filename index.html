            <p>I am Mateo, a Colombian living in Canada, currently studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. 
            This academic experience has allowed me to explore new passions and strengthen my skills.</p>
            <p>This time has been more than an educational path; it has also been an opportunity to grow professionally 
            by working at places that I'd never imagined I could, like the Government of Canada, and a unique occasion for self-growth.</p>
            <p>Being in Canada has shown me endless possibilities, like trying new cuisines, visting new places,  meeting people from all over the world, enjoying seasons (coping with winter), and 
            developing a deep appreciation for diversity and inclusion.</p>
