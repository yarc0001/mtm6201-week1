            <p>I am Mateo, a Colombian living in Canada, and I am currently studying the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. 
            This academic experience has allowed me to explore new passions and strengthen my skills.
            <p> However, this time has been more than an educational path; it has also been an opportunity to grow professionally 
              by working at places that I'd never imagined I could, like the Government of Canada, and a unique occasion for self-growth.
              Being in Canada has shown me endless possibilities, like trying new cuisines, meeting people from all over the world, and 
              developing a deep appreciation for diversity and acceptance.</p>
